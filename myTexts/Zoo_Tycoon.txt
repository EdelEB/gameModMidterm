Zoo Tycoon

This mod will allow the player to create their own zoo filled with enemies and bosses from Quake 4.
There will be pads on the ground that allow you to walk up and activate them; on activate, you will
be asked what kind of enclosure you want to buy. Once the enclosures are bought there will be monitors
on the side of them saying whether or not they are hungry or thirsty, which the player is responsible
to keep up probably through using weapons which have been changed to "feeder" and "waterer." If the
hunger or thirst gets too low, animals die and it costs money to buy more. Money is earned based on 
how many enclosures you have and how happy the animals are. All enclosures must be prebuilt or
room is open to allow customizable enclosures. Creating walkways/fences/trashcans around the park 
are also available.

Weapons Ideas:
feeder
water bucket
deleter

Deliverables:
guests
ability to spawn and have functioning enclosures
5 animals minimum with different upfront cost
3 vendors types, hunger for guests
research facility to unlock more creatures & vendors
