# Strogg Zoo Tycoon
by Edel Barcenas

Build and maintain your very own zoo filled the Strogg of your choosing. 
Build enclosures and shops.
The more enclosures you have and the happier you keep your Strogg, the more people will visit and the more money you will make.

Side Notes:
	The shortcut to boot into the mod is in myModShortcut. I had to make quake's ".exe" file a ".bin" and add a ".bat" to make it work.
	Press 'h' in-game to pull up the help menuv
	Your blaster is a tranquilizer gun that will one-shot all strogg
